# Wanted: Deno / Hono / DataStar

## 2025-11-03

I found about [Hypermedia Systems](https://hypermedia.systems/) and that lead me to [htmx](https://htmx.org/), but then I did some research and looked up for a Typescript version, and found [DataStar](https://data-star.dev/).

Also, I found out that many pair _htmx_ with [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/), and _DataStar_ provides features of both, making unnecessary to add another library or framework.

Sadly, _DataStar_ is not fully open source and currently its price for a solo developer is USD $349. I read some comments around the web complaining that some very needed features on normal web development are behind this paid license. However I should give it a try nonetheless and draw my own conclusions.

I want to run a [Hono](https://hono.dev/) server under [Deno](https://deno.com/).

Database will be either [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) or [PostgreSQL](https://www.sqlite.org/) depending on the size and complexity of the project.

I'm completely lost regarding styles, but I looked up for **classless CSS frameworks** and all these options appeared:

- [Pico.css](https://picocss.com/)
- [Water.css](https://watercss.kognise.dev/)
- [New.css](https://newcss.net/)
- [MVP.css](https://andybrewer.github.io/mvp/)

All very simple and maybe only for small projects and MVPs. But I also found:

- [Shadcn-classless](https://github.com/fordus/shadcn-classless)
  No TailwindCss, it deserves to be tried.
