# Dropped: Deno / Fresh

## 2025-12-18

It's my desire to migrate from Node.js into Deno as it's cleaner, Typescript first, and incorporates dev tooling that in the world of Node.js is a mess and a pain to track.

Just recently I switched from Eslint+Prettier into Biome on a Node.js project, and that switch allowed me to drop around 10 dev dependencies. So while now Biome make the things less messy, I still think Deno should be the future.

I tried at the beggining of 2025 a simple project with [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/) and it's the same React philosophy I'm trying to leave behind. So I said no.

I still want Deno, but I will have to hunt for the other technologies to compose a tech stack with it.
