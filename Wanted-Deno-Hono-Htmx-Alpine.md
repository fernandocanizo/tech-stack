# Wanted: Deno / Hono / Htmx / Alpine.js

I want to try [Deno](https://deno.com/) paired with [Hono](https://deno.com/) on the backend and [htmx](https://htmx.org/) with [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/).

It's possible that I try a Typescript version of _htmx_, I recall I found one but I couldn't find the link now. **TODO:** find it!
